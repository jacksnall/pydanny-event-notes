Let's talk about cloud
----------------------

* The term *cloud* has been ruined
* ground rules:

    * Cloud - elastic infrastructure providing compute, network, and storage via well-defined APIs
    
    * Public cloud - A multi-tenant, publicly available cloud where resources are metered and billed as a utility, and any entity can place workloads.
    
        * Often makes money by charging monthly or service fees
        
    * Private cloud - A privately owned cloud generally used by a single organization for one or more applications

* Use it to build public or private clouds

    * VMs
    * Volumes
    * Multi-tenancy
    * APIS - well defined and documented
