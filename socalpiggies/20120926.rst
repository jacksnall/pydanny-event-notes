Introduction to OpenStack
=========================

By Jonathon LaCour

    * Experienced 15 years with Python
    * Dreamhost lead developer
    * Teaches high level Python classes too

Let's talk about cloud
----------------------

* The term *cloud* has been ruined
* ground rules:

    * Cloud - elastic infrastructure providing compute, network, and storage via well-defined APIs
    
    * Public cloud - A multi-tenant, publicly available cloud where resources are metered and billed as a utility, and any entity can place workloads.
    
        * Often makes money by charging monthly or service fees
        
    * Private cloud - A privately owned cloud generally used by a single organization for one or more applications
    
What is OpenStack?
-------------------

* OpenStack is a cloud operating system or cloud management system
* Use it to build public or private clouds

    * VMs
    * Volumes
    * Multi-tenancy
    * APIS - well defined and documented
    
History of OpenStack
---------------------

* 2008 - NASA creates Nebula
* 2009 - Rackspace creates Swift
* 2010 - OpenStack is born!

.. note:: My last few months at NASA we were begging and pleading for the right to use Nebula so we didn't have to deal with standard NASA server provisioning which is both time intensive 

Components of OpenStack
------------------------

* Nova

    * OpenStack's Compute controller, originally created by NASA
    * Communicates with the hypervisor to create/destroy VMs
    * "Schedules"where VMs are created
    * Originally handled network and storage allocation
    * RESTful API
    
* Swift

    * Object storage system created by Rackspace
    * Highly available, distributed, and eventually consistent
    * RESTful APIs - S3 and Swift
    * Can be swapped out for Ceph, a unified distributed storage system created at Dreamhost
