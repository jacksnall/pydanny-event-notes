What is Redis?
================

* In-memory database/data structure server

    * Limited to main memory; vm and diskstore defunct
    
* Persistence via snapshot or append-only file
* Support for master/slave replication (multiple slaves and slave chaining supported)

    * No master-master, don't even try. In other words, if you have two masters running on the same system, you'll have serious, major, painful issues.
    * Client-side sharding
    * Cluster is in-progress

* Supports data structures + publish.subscribe

    * Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets (ZSETs)

* Server-side scripting with Lua in Redis 2.6

Comparing Redis to other databases/caches
================================================

* Memcached

    * in-memory, no-persistence, counters, strings, very fast, multi-threaded
