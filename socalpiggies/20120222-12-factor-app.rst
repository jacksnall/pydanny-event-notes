Where we've been
================

* Version control

    * folders
    * cvs/svn
    * git/mercurial

* Dependency Management

    * `python setup.py install`
    * `easy_install somepackage`
    
* Deployment

    * rsync myproject runserver
    * scp

Where we're going
===================

* Modern Version Control makes it possible to:

    * 1 code base with many deploys 
    
* Dependency Management

    * `pip install somepackage`
    * `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

* Deployment

    * Capistrano
    * Tarball
    * slug
    * Bundle everything together so rollbacks are trivial
    
What is 12 Factor?
==================

A set of practices used by Heroku that serves as a mantra as to what they are doing.

* Declarative Setup - Minimize setup time
* Clean contracts - Portability to run anywhere
* Deploy practices - Cloud and horizontal scaling
* Minimize Divergence - Continuous Deployment

Dev/Prod Parity
================

* Dev = Staging = Prod
* sqlite != postgres = postgres

.. warning:: Don't use sqlite in dev or you get screwed! This happened to me!
