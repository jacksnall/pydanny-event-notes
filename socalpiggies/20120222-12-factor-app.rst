Where we've been
================

* Version control

    * folders
    * cvs/svn
    * git/mercurial

* Dependency Management

    * `python setup.py install`
    * `easy_install somepackage`
    
* Deployment

    * rsync myproject runserver
    * scp

Where we're going
===================

* Modern Version Control makes it possible to:

    * 1 code base with many deploys 
    
* Dependency Management

    * `pip install somepackage`
    * `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

* Deployment

    * Capistrano
    * Tarball
    * slug
    * Bundle everything together so rollbacks are trivial
