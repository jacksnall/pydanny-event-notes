Knowing Things on June 6, 2011
==============================

By Jeff Schenk

.. note:: Way too many comments from one person who kept taking him off topic so I asked Jeff to not take so many questions. Not sure how well that went over...

Ad.ly's story
==============

* Kinda knowing things is easy
* Really knowing with certainty a lot of complex things is maybe harder
* Need to know things with precision is really important

Thing Types
===========

* Integers (how many people clicked)
* Strings
* Booleans
* Bling (money)
* Time

Bling
=====

Do you want to misplace money and get fired? No? Use Decimal::

    from decimal import Decimal
    moneys = Decimal('100.01')

Decimal oddities in rounding so use quantize::

    >>> moneys  / 2
    Decimal('50.005') # Copied something wrong here..
    
    # so use quantize
    >>> (moneys / 2).quantize('001')
    Decimal('50.005') # ... or maybe here cause these numbers are the same

Time
=====

* Timezones suck
* Computers like integers
* So they use hours since epoch
* all the work is done in about 10 lines of Python code.

Storage
=======

* SQL

    * Joins are death
    * If you join, you will die
    * intelligent index are super
    * if you're going to group bu it or filter on it, you probably want it indexed.
    
* Pre-Aggregate

    * When you're working with a lot of data, you need to aggregate chunks as you go.
    * `My Guess`: A lot of Celery tasks!
    * Spooned into a single report table that breaks normalization
    
Iterate
========

They use itertools a lot!

 * itertools.chain is your friend
 * itertools.tee is also your friend 

heapq
======

Algorithms makes merging of iterables really powerful::

    import heapq
    for result in heapq.merge(query1, query2):
        # merge results and know they are in order
        print(result)

Caching is key!
=================

 * They need flexibility to slice and dice the data
 * Once its been sliced, they want to be able to view, page, and sort the data
 * Redis gives the speed of cache with the power to sort and page
 * They use `redis-py` as their library

Questions
===========

 * Test coverage?
