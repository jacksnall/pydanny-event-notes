Asynchronous programming techniques
====================================

.. note:: My normal answer is to use Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ to handle this stuff.

by TODO: ask the name of speaker

* *Walked in the on the part about Twisted...*
* Threads vs processes are a debatable issue.
* Cost of using Python to create new processes is considered slow
* Blocking and memory access issues
* Async is a problem in Python because not all libraries support it
* GIL

    * Multiple threads in Python are OS processes and you can get blocking on memory objects
    * On large processes on things like `dict` hash-tables you can get blocks/locks on the wrong thing
    
Multiprocessing
----------------

* Called 'giant hack'
* Looks likes the threads API
* Uses a messages system to use OS processes to share data between processes/threads
* Uses pickles to share data via messages, which means anything that is deserialized executes the code

    * Which means you should watch out for code injection!

Communicating Sequential Processes
------------------------------------

* Title of an academic paper
* A system of sharing tasks and data

Gevent
------

* Wonderful monkey patch that does the bulk of the work needed for multi-tasking.
* Does not use threads, replaces certain libraries on the fly.
* I've played with it, and it is fun.
* See:

.. sourcecode:: python

    monkey.patch_all()
