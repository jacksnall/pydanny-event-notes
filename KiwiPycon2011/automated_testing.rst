Step 1 - Have unit tests
==========================

* Debugging is fast
* Find bugs elsewhere
* Blame

    * Feel free to point fingers at who did it

* look GOOD
* Nose!

    * Finds tests and runs them
    * Logging capture
    * STDOUT
    
* Running single tests

Disney Stuff
=============

WETA digital uses Disney open source code!

 * Pythoscope
 
    * Reads your python
    * Writes a stub unit test for all your methods
    * "*You'll have 100% code coverage and everything will fail!*"
