========================================
Automated testing in Python and beyond
========================================

by Brenda Wallace

.. note:: missed the beginning :(

Have unit tests
================

* Debugging is fast
* Find bugs elsewhere
* Blame

    * Feel free to point fingers at who did it

* look GOOD
* Nose!

    * Finds tests and runs them
    * Logging capture
    * STDOUT
    
* Running single tests

Disney Stuff
=============

WETA digital uses Disney open source code!

 * Pythoscope
 
    * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pythoscope
    * Reads your python
    * Writes a stub unit test for all your methods
    * "*You'll have 100% code coverage and everything will fail!*"

Other language test frameworks
========================================

Everyone forks and no one works together

Java
----

* JUnit
* JTiger
* TestNG
* Looks like Python, but with more words

Perl
----

* PerlUnit
* Over 60 other test frameworks!!!

PHP
----

* PhpUnit
* SimpleTest is cool

Erlang
------

* EUnit
* Best intro to testing ever.

Write Tests
=============

* Write tests before you write code

    * I switched from the Shell to writing Unit Tests as well!
    * This is how I write a huge majority of my tests.
    
Re-run
======

* Hudson/Jenkins

    * Oracle Sucks

* Just do it
* I want this to have a service to do setup for you.
