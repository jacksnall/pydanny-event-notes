Those niggly beginner's questions answered by a code craft ninja
==================================================================

by Tim Penhey and Rachel Penhey

.. note:: I love going to `beginner` Python talks. You often learn or relearn nice tricks you can implement today.

Audience Design
================

* Aimed at Python beginners
* Aimed at programmers beginners
* Audience questions at the end
* Won't take the full hour unless there are questions later

.. note:: Had to leave early. :(
