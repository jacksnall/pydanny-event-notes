Python in the Web: Can we keep up?
==================================

By Audrey Roy

*I'm partial but I think she did a great job of pointing out where Python might/should go.*


Metaprogramming
===============

By Jeff Rush

"*Metaprogramming is the programming of programming*"

.. note:: Apologies, but I couldn't keep up with the firehouse of knowledge. This is woefully incomplete.

.. warning:: This is from me: Metaprogramming should be done carefully. Only use it when you have no other options!

This talk makes use of
----------------------

    * metaclasses
    * decorators
    * attributes
    * more
  
What is metaprogramming orientation
-----------------------------------

  
 * Code **Manipulates** Data
 * Data **Feeds into** Code
 * Metaprogramming sits about the Code/Data
    
        * Add/adjust elements
        * register elements
        * tag elements
        * event management
        
            * Pre/post initialization
            * read/write
            * call-and-return
            
Addressing a problem
--------------------

.. sourcecode:: python

    class Request(object):
        
    class HTTPServer(object):
        def handle_request(self, ...):
            req = Request(...)
            
* objective

    * subclass a class deep inside a module
    * Requires rearrangement content of the module

.. sourcecode:: python

    old_import = sys.modules['__builtin__']
    sys.models['__builtin__'].__import__ = self.__import__
    
Sample code
-----------

.. sourcecode:: python

    class Member(object):
        __metaclass__ = DatabaseTable
        
        dbtable = "Members"
        
    class DatabaseTable(type):
    
        def __init__(cls, name, bases, class_dict):
            col_defs = db.query_cols()
            for col_def in col_defs:
                db_column = wrap_col_rdwr(col_def) 
                setattr(cls, col_def.name, db_column)
    
    def wrap_col_rdwr(col_def):
        def get_dbcol_value(self):
            return self.__dict__.get(col_def.name, None)
            
        def set_dbcol_value(self, value):
            value = col_def.validate(value)
            self._-dict__[col_def.name] = value
            
        return property(get_dbcol_value, set_dbcol_name)
                

Meta classes? class decorators
--------------------------------

* The latter are much simpler
* The latter can do almost everything the former can

    * only a metaclass can add methods to the class itself
    
* class-level services (methods)

    * @classmethods provide them to instance
    * metaclass methods provide them to the class itself
    
* only a metaclass can add to class attrs not visible to self

    * meta-methods
    * meta-properties
    
* Class decorated can be (more easily stacked)
* MISSED BULLET

Example using class decorator
-----------------------------------

.. sourcecode:: python

    def CallTracer(attr):
        """ Do custom logic stuff here """
        return attr

    def tracecalls(cls):
    
        def my__getattribute(self, name):
        
            attr - super(cls, self).__getattribute__(name)
            return attr if not callable(attr) else CallTracer(attr)
            
        cls.__getatttribute__ = my__getattribute
        return cls
    
    @tracecalls
    class MyClass(object):
        pass

Diving into attribute manipulators
-----------------------------------

The talk dived a bit into things like:

* `__getattribute__`
* `__getattr__`

Diving into this sort of code is tricky, because the reasons for use of these tools is
not necessary in 99% of Python projects. I prefer to rely on `decorators` to alter behavior 
because they are syntactical sugar. Easy to find and very explicit.


relate or !relate
==================

by Mark Ramm

* "*Python has been very good to me*"
* Double major in Philosophy, Literature and minors in Theatre and something else
* Wrote the TurboGears 1 book and became a web developer

Opening
-------

* Tools matter

    * Python is a great tool
    * "SQLAlchemy is the best ORM on the planet regardless of language"
    
* Data matters just as much 

Tools matter
------------

* Know your tools

    * Screws and nails

        * deck (screws are stronger than nails, but harder to use)
        * siding (nailing yourself to the siding)
        * mongodb (nailed the SourceForge team to the wall via MongoDB)

**Takeaway**: If you don't know your tools when you hit production you are going to be trying to debug something critical.

SQL
----

"*Who here has used a non-relational database? Not many? Oh, there's this thing called a FILESYSTEM.*"

ACID
~~~~

    * Atomicity
    * Consistency
    * Independent
    * Durable

Why I NEED relational
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * I can't use NoSQL because
 
    * It's financial data (need consistency)
    * my data is relational
    
Mark says **BULLSHIT**

    * Amazon tracks financial data using NoSQL
    * You can make things more durable and consistent if you know what you are doing
    
Reason to use SQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Well known, easier to find people who know it
* Robust, scalable, flexible, simple
* pretty ACID

Really good reasons to use RDBS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* DSL for ad-hock queries understood by everyone
    
    * Business and marketing types can run their own queries

* blah blah inconsistencies blah blah latency
* Being down is better than being wrong

    * Critical for medical applications!
    
NoSQL
-----

Many different types:

* key/value store
* distributed key/value store
* column oriented stores
* map-reduce store/system
* documented oriented store

    * MongoDB
    * CouchDB
    * XML (now we use JSON instead of this)
    * ZODB (A really good system in Python - just so long as you don't want to share your data with other languages)

* graph oriented stores

CAP theorem
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

* Consistency
* Availability
* Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss)

Google and Facebook scale has to handle downtown gracefully so has to choose which of these three things they'll focus on

Focused
~~~~~~~~~

NoSQL systems tend to have a few but not all of the following bullets:

* Scalable
* Simple
* Fast
* Flexible
* Topic

It's WebScale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mark calls **BULLSHIT**

* 99% of sites don't care about this issue
* 99% of people are okay if their sites have a feature that fails on a continent
* Think about what you actually need

    * Don't implement a database just cause it's cool

* merciless.sourceforge.net

.. sourcecode:: sql

    select * from document where x=3 and y="foo"

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    b.things.find({x:3, y: "foo"});
