Introduction
=============

Quotes:

* "*Django is the web framework for perfectionists for deadlines.*"
* "*A framework is something you can hang stuff off of - it is a structure.*"

Frameworks vs CMS's
====================

* Frameworks take longer to set up
* Frameworks are for specific applications
* Frameworks only do what you plan them to do
* Few wasted features
