================
Django for n00bs
================

by Jen Zajac

* Works for Catalyst

Introduction
=============

Quotes:

* "*Django is the web framework for perfectionists for deadlines.*"
* "*A framework is something you can hang stuff off of - it is a structure.*"

Frameworks vs CMS's
====================

* Frameworks take longer to set up
* Frameworks are for specific applications
* Frameworks only do what you plan them to do
* Few wasted features

Django backstory
====================

* Started in 2003 at LJ World
* Open sourced in 2005
* Hit 1.0 in 2008
* Other frameworks

    * Pyramid (awesome)
    * Zope (over engineered)
    * Bottle (I prefer Flask)
    * TurboGears (IMHO deprecated until it is converted to Pyramid)
    
Pros and cons of Django
=======================

Pros:

* Big community
* Tightly integrated components
* Built-in interface
* Documentation
* Release process
* Authentication & Security

Jen Cons:

* Not playing so well with others

Danny Cons:

* No defined best practices by Django core devs
* Documentation has stagnated in places
* Documentation could use better organization
* Needs to be better at explaining itself as not a framework for programming beginners
* Some WSGI weirdness that is being resolved shortly
