Struggling to Find an Open Source Business Model
================================================

by Grant Paton-Simpson

Abstract
========

After more than 45,000 downloads, the open source Python project SOFA Statistics has netted $90 (not $90k, just $90). This presentation will explain strategies tried so far, and the options available to open source projects.

* SOFA project
* 65,000 downloads
* Lots of positive reviews
* http://sofastatistics.com

Monetisation
=============

* Surely must be possible to sell affordable to at least 0.5-2%
* Apparently a common rate for single-vendor commercial open source firms
