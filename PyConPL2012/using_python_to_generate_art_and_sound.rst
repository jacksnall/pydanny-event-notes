============



I’ve used Python to draw rainbows of different shapes and colors, Gaussian clouds, and landscapes in perspective. I’ve also used Python to create sound effects for games. This talk explores my experiments with the various Python imaging and sound tools. First, I walk the audience through implementing basic audio building blocks with the Python stdlib's wave, math, and array modules. Then, I improve upon the code with NumPy and SciPy. Finally, I demonstrate how audio synthesis can be very similar to generative graphic art, using similar techniques to create building blocks for basic illustration.
