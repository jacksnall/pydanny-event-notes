* Dissecting the Julian/Gregorian calendar
* Mesopotamian mathematics
* Time zones
* Recurring events is less fun than you think.

Introduction
==============

.. epigraph:: The problem with calendaring is that it is based off of multiple cycles that don't work well with each other

**Rome:** They had a 10 month calendar that made winter a dead period in the calendar. Eventually they added January and February
