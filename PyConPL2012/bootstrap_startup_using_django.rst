Talk Description
================

Based on the experiences building Gidsy.com this talk will give you valuable insights as to how your infrastructure will evolve and how to set up the basic components (load balancer, web servers, DB, caching, celery, CDN, â€¦) of your site.


What is Gidsy?
================

Gidsy is a place where anyone can explore, book and offer things to do.

Why did they choose Django?
===========================

* Big community
* Network
* Language
* Many problems already solved
* The Admin

Why Django is a good choice?
==============================

* Proven technology by similar use cases
* Stable APIs in a well-defined release process
* Good documentation with focus on prose
* Huge community of 3rd party components

Implementing search
=====================

**Haystack**:  http://www.haystacksearch.org/

* Needed customizable search abstraction
* Indexing, filtering, faceting, "More like this"
* Spatial search and sorting

Implementing API
=================

**Tastypie**: http://tastypieapi.org/

* Highly customizable Web API library
* Hooks for auth, throttling, caching, etc
* Backbone.js compatible

Task Queues
============

**Celery**: http://celeryproject.org/

If you have a user triggered process that will take a long time, use an asynchronous task queue to manage the task

* Async code execution
* Generate thumbnails, search index updates, caching, etc
* Collect stats without blocking

Caching
========

**Memcached**

* Periodic cache refreshing for high traffic sites
* Fragment caching with dates and cache version
* Cache warming during deployment

Workflow
=========

.. epigraph:: "Always check in a module cleaner then when you checked it out." -- Uncle Bob

* Main branch is always deployable
* Development happens in feature branches
* Code reviews via pull requests
* Shared responsibility

Testing
========

* Seperation of fast and slow tests
* Full test suite via private Travis CI project
* Fast tests locally with django-discover-runner

Releasing
=============

* Virtualenv/pip
* localshop as local PyPI host
* django-configurations for Django Settings
* Upstart for processes management

Scaling up
===========

* TODO - get slide that I missed

Deploy System
===============

* Builds are virtualenvs
* Atomic and orchestrated releases
* Lots of notifications
* Mix of Chef and Fabric
* Trying to open source it
* Using New Relic and Hipchat to track things
* Operations made as easy as possible via knife and fabric




Questions
============

* Do they use a specific Catching library or the Django API?
