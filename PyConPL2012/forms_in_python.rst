Talk Description
=================

My lecture would consist of two parts. First I would like to discuss what can a developer expect from a form library. Secondly I will show a design of one that would address all these problems.

Why are they important?
========================

Forms are ubiquitous across all Python frameworks

* Python is a strongly typed language so we have to handle input properly
* Closest to the user 

    * What they see most
    * This is where they tend to see our mistakes
    
* Our first line of defense against security against CSRF and other attack methods.
* Boilerplate and repition removal

Scope of Features
====================

All form libraries need to have the following components:

* User input handling

    * Type coercion
    * Validation
    
* Widget generation
* Data schema reflection

    * Critical boilerplate reduction
    * Try not to define both data and form schema
    
Challenges
==========

* Flexible but not full of feature creep

    * Easy to grow too big
    * but you can't make the project unmanageable
    
* Allow reflection but don't bind user's hands

    * If you can't modify the reflection then the form library quickly becomes useless on real projects

* Portable but allows developers to use specific features

    * If coupled too tightly then it's hard to move to other projects
    * If coupled too loosely then API can suffer.
