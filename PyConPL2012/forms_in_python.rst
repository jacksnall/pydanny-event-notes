Talk Description
=================

My lecture would consist of two parts. First I would like to discuss what can a developer expect from a form library. Secondly I will show a design of one that would address all these problems.

Introduction
============

The basis of reviews:

Why are they important?
-----------------------

Forms are ubiquitous across all Python frameworks

* Python is a strongly typed language so we have to handle input properly
* Closest to the user 

    * What they see most
    * This is where they tend to see our mistakes
    
* Our first line of defense against security against CSRF and other attack methods.
* Boilerplate and repition removal

Scope of Features
-----------------------

All form libraries need to have the following components:

* User input handling

    * Type coercion
    * Validation
    
* Widget generation
* Data schema reflection

    * Critical boilerplate reduction
    * Try not to define both data and form schema
    
Challenges
-----------------------

* Flexible but not full of feature creep

    * Easy to grow too big
    * but you can't make the project unmanageable
    
* Allow reflection but don't bind user's hands

    * If you can't modify the reflection then the form library quickly becomes useless on real projects

* Portable but allows developers to use specific features

    * If coupled too tightly then it's hard to move to other projects
    * If coupled too loosely then API can suffer.
    
FormEncode
===========

* By Ian Book
* Minimalist: only validation, coercion, html-filling
* Was recommended by Pylons book
* **Problem**: No schema reflection

Django Forms
=============

* Second attempt
* Plays best in the Django framework
* **Problem**: Hard to create new widgets

.. code-block:: python

    class AuthorForm(forms.ModelForm):
    
        class Meta:
            model = Author
            fields = ['name', 'email', ]
            
Sprox
======

* Combines FormEncode and ToscaWidgets
* Extendable and easy to create new widgets
* **Problem**: unpleasant API

FormAlchemy
===========

* Built on idea of shcema reflection
* Generates forms and tables
* Type coercion
