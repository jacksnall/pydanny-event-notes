Backbone: The framework that isn't
====================================

.. note:: Presenter used a presentation tool that doesn't have a back button. Ahem.

Lots of hot client frameworks
------------------------------

* Angular
* Ember
* Knockout
* Spine
* Backbone

Backbone is kind of opinionated
-----------------------------------

The fact that it leaves out even basic framework structure yet makes you make your own decisions

* but you shouldn't have to rewrite boilerplate
* and you should still have a set of drop-in components that work well together
* You should have the freedom to do what you want.

What do frameworks provide?
---------------------------------------

* Models
* Views
* Controllers
* Presenters
* Observers
* Routers

In other words, the glue you need to make something work.

What does backbone provide?
------------------------------

* Models

.. code-block:: javascript

    var view - new SandwichView({model: rueben});
    // view.model attribute set to reuben
    
* Events instead of callbacks

.. code-block:: javascript

    this.collection.on('add', this.addItemView, this);
    
    function(item){
        view.$('.js.item.container').append(
            (new SomeItemView({model:item})).render().el
        );
    }
    
* Ability to combine template context and user data

.. code-block:: javascript

    var BaseView = Backbone.View.extend({
        // snip giant chunk of code
    });
    
* Do the anti-pattern of having a fat router

.. code-block:: javascript

    app = Backbone.Router.Extend({
        // snip giant router function
    
    });
    
Backbone opinions
-----------------

* Tight coupling between models and views that represent them.
* 4 classes and a default sync sync method and kid of sets you loose with them
* Doesn't force you to follow a 'Backbone Way'.
* If your app isn't trivial, Backbone might not be the right choice
* If you need to handle lots of DOM and JS executions, Backbone might be a right choice.
