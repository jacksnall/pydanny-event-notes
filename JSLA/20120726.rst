Backbone: The framework that isn't
====================================

* by @thedaniel

.. note:: Used a presentation tool that doesn't have a back button. Ahem.

Lots of hot client frameworks
------------------------------

* Angular
* Ember
* Knockout
* Spine
* Backbone

Backbone is kind of opinionated
-----------------------------------

The fact that it leaves out even basic framework structure yet makes you make your own decisions

* but you shouldn't have to rewrite boilerplate
* and you should still have a set of drop-in components that work well together
* You should have the freedom to do what you want.

What do frameworks provide?
---------------------------------------

* Models
* Views
* Controllers
* Presenters
* Observers
* Handlers
