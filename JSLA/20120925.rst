Text Mining 
===========

* Speaker: Danny Tran
* Works for Walt Disney
 
80% of all data is unstructured text
========================================

* Sentiment analysis is how you do mining
* Understanding huge amounts of Twitter data
* Wanted to figure out how to investigate this via node.js

Types of Sentiment
--------------------

* Polarity: Positive or negative
* Continuous: -10 to +10
* Categorical: Happy, sad, angry, frustrated

Assumptions
------------

* Bag of Words
* English

Techniques
------------

* Semantic Summation
* Machine learning classification

Pre-processing
--------------

* Unrepeat (His description of long terms like `sweeeeeet`)
* Entity Extraction (Pulling out nouns/entities from text have to not skew the results. For example: Fight against **evil** can make a positive description sound bad)
* Tokenization

    * Problem: Abbreviations
    * Problem: Emoticons

* Spell correct http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
* Word stopping
* Limitization

    * Reduce word to it's root form
    * Result is a word
    * Running => Run

* Stemming

    * Reduce word to a stem
    * May not be a word
    * Carry => Cari

Naive Bayes Classifer
---------------------

TODO: Show javascript example

.. note:: the data coming needs to train this algorithm

Getting training data
----------------------

* sentiment140.com
* Use emoticons to pre-classify text

Test!
------

* Against 70k+ records from sentiment140.com
* Humans only agree 70-80% of the time so don't expect perfection
