Types of Sentiment
--------------------

* Polarity: Positive or negative
* Continuous: -10 to +10
* Categorical: Happy, sad, angry, frustrated

Assumptions
------------

* Bag of Words
* English

Techniques
------------

* Semantic Summation
* Machine learning classification

Pre-processing
--------------

* Unrepeat (His description of long terms like `sweeeeeet`)
* Entity Extraction (Pulling out nouns/entities from text have to not skew the results. For example: Fight against **evil** can make a positive description sound bad)
* Tokenization

    * Problem: Abbreviations
    * Problem: Emoticons

.. code-block:: javascript

    var natural = require('natural);
