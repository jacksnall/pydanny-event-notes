================================

Intro
=======

* Python is more than just OO, it's also functional
* Almost every language we use is imperative
* Python can be functional

The cheatsheet for this talk
====================================

* **map()**
* **filter()**
* **functools** module
* **itertools** module
* list comprehensions
* generators

Functional programming is....
==============================

* ... difficult to define precisely
* Good! (most worthwhile systems are)

Maybe this?
-------------

* transform data structures, don't manipulate state

Most useful?
--------------

* concentrate on function return values, not side-effects

Python Functions
==================

* Functions are first class objects
* You can pass them around as arguments to other functions
* You can construct them dynamically

.. code-block:: python

    def my_function():
        print "hello"
        
    def show_string(func, arg):
        print func() + arg
        
    >>> show_string(my_function, " Goodbye!")
    hello Goodbye!
    
Useful language features
===========================

* **lambda** expressions
* **functools** module
* **itertools** module
