* Affiliated of Wikimedia Philippines, Inc
* Good advocacy talk

How you attract tourists
========================================

* ...use paid television ads?
* ...use print ads?
* ...use social media?
* ...and still be consistent

Mount a campaign!
===================

* Slogan: It's more fun in the Philippines!

* Logo and slogan alone do not make a good campaign

People need to know:
====================

* What's in it for me?

Why Python?
=============

* The usual 'advocacy' stuff.
* Very, very gentle learning curve

    * Even complete newbies can understand

Prototyping/Gluing
==================

* Easily done with Python

    * Low-level modules in another language (like C or C++)
    * Then Python joins 'em all together
    
* Python's simplicity allows easy rewrites of prototypes

    * competitive edge over C/C++/Java
    
Python is...SIMPLE
====================

* Faster learning curve

    * Easier to pick up than 'traditional' Filipino CS 101 languages
    * Focus on thinking, not synxtax
    
* More readable than other languages

    * Probably influenced by GvR's math background
    * Similar to pseudo code
    * Hard to obfuscate 

Works with JAVA and .Net!!!
===========================

* Reality: IT industry in PH is Java/.Net centric
* problem:

    * We've already invested in Java/.Net technologies - will we have to rewrite the stuff?
    * NO!
