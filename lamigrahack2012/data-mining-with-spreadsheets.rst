The CPS table creator allows to mine data from the March analysis of Census data.

Workforce data to consider for immigrant data analysis
=======================================================

Generate a report using the following criteria

* Education Attainment (sidebar)
* Nativity: Point of origin (sidebar)
* California (topbar)

You should now have data worth mining!

Time to interview the data!
-----------------------------

* Paste the generated data into your spreadsheet of choice.
* Select the highest row with numbers and enter something like into the first empty cell to the right: `=D1/B1`
* Copy/paste the **formula only** to the empty cells corresponding to the other rows.
* Format the results to show percentages

Adjusting the Data
-----------------------------
 
* Under 'Data Options' change the year to 2007 (sidebar)
* Formula for comparing 2012 with 2007:

    * ``new - old / old``

What does this show?
-----------------------------

* Incoming workforce with high school and post-high school education dropped
* **Surprise**: Incoming workforce with bachelor's degree or higher is increasing. 

    * Might be because more immigrants coming in have bachelor's degrees.
    * Might be because more immigrants are getting bachelor's degrees.
    * No way to figure out what this means from the data available. We need a journalist to investigate!
