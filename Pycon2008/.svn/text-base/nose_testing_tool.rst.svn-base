nose and TDD
============
 * Write tests first so you never have any wasted code
 * For this, writing and running tests has t be easy
 * And the tests have to be useful, especially when they fail
 
How laziness drove the development of NOSE
------------------------------------------
 * traditional unittest is high-frcition
 * py.test is great, but hard to install and complex
 * no boilerplate
 
Basic of Nose
------------------------------------
 * Extends unittest, doesn't replace it
 * use assert to test
 * use print for debugging
 * generative tests
 
Reasons to use nose
-------------------
 * nose makes it easier to write and run useful tests
 * useful tests make it easier to write useful code
