Why write automate tests
========================
 * Because you want your code to work
 * You want your code to meet customer expectations
 * Because you want to simplify your programming life
 * Because you often over/under design your code
 
Goal: Become 'Test Infected'
============================
 * Integrate 'testing way' into your daily life
 * It is now actually psychologically uncomfortable for me to write code that is difficult to test
 
Some test guidelines
====================
 * keep your testing infrastructure as simple and stupid as possible
 * Testing should help you write & debug your other code, not become a major part of the codebase in and of itself...
 * Always be ready to throw out your test code!
 * start small
 * build tests incrementally
 * Smoke tests are absurdly useful
 * Test simply, at many levels
 * focus on actual problem areas (existing bugs).
 * Continuously integrate
 
Using testing as part of your process
=====================================
 * Use tests personally, even if other people don't
 * Manage up and across
 * Automate what can be easily automated, nothing more. (Corollary: plan for testability)
 * Smart small and KISS
 
Test Enhanced Development
=========================
 * Test Driven Development: write tests first
 * Stupidity driven testing: write tests after you do something stupid, to make sure you never make the same mistake again.  a.k.a. Test Enhanced Development
 
Constrain your code
===================
 * Document your expectations, internally and externally
 * Use asset more
 * Write unit, functional, and regression tests in terms of expectations
 
Tracer Bullet Development
=========================
 * Check to see your basics work before testing anything else
 * If it does not work, go no further
 * Exercise your your setup and teardown code
 * Gives you a base from which to expand

Build a test umbrella
=====================
 * One command -> all tests
 * Integrate reporting
 * Ease of use and startup
 * No memory required
 
Code coverage
=============
 * People will tell you that 100% line coverage is a bad idea
 * But if you don't test every line of code then you can't know if every line of code works
 
Continuous Integration
======================
 * Run all tests with a single click
 * Help you figure out if your code still works
 * Helps you in many subtle ways like package dependencies
 
Deliver Test results as part of the customer interaction process
================================================================
 * Try and show them the test results on a periodic basis
 
Summary
=======
 * Testing should be an integral part of your process
 * If its not working for you, don't force it but don't give up, either
 * Address real problems
 * Simplify
 * There is no try, only do
 
Twill
=========
 * Really nice testing suite
 * Combined with WSGI intercept is really nice

Nose
=======
 * nosetests looks in files called 'tests' and will run the tests there
 * Runs 'em as you wrote them.  Nice for integrated tests
 
Fitness
=======
 * Look up this testing tool
