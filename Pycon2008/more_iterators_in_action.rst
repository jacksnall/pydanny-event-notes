===================
Iterators in action
===================

Overview
========

 * Functional LINQ
 * Recursvie Generators

Functional LINQ
===============

 * LIN primitives
 
  - Relational Algebra
  - map, reduce reduce
  
 * Lots of functionality
 * Language INtegrated uery
 * Streaming
 
Row composition
===============

 * `__iter__`, `next`
 * All iterators use it
 
Column Composition
===================

 * Colums are harder
 * Fundamental ops in relational algerbra
 
Naming
===============

 * Solution to integration in python is naming
 * namespaces
 
namedtuple
===============

 * Sublcassing the tuple type
 * associated the column names with an index in the tiple
 * part of 2.6 - collections.namedtuple # LOOK THIS UP!!!
 
Select
======

 * write helper functions
 * look up tee - part of itertool.tee
 
operator.itemgetter
===================

 * extracts multiple items from a seuence
 
create join primitives
======================

 * hash_join adding two iters on a defined predicate
 
Research items
==============

 * itertools in general
 * collections.namedtuple
 * collections in general
 
Concepts for use
=================

 * Joining SQl data with other data for mashups
 * Best to convert all data to namedtuples because then you have more finicky control
 
Recursive Generators
====================

 * # cookbook recipe 190465
 * Graph traversal across edges and nodes
 * Workhorse algorithm
 * Bone up on yields again
 
Fork
=====

 * 2.5+
 * Given a generator runs it in a separate thread
 * Look up fork
 
Global Interpreter Lock
=======================

 * Not in `cpython` or in `jython`
 * from `__future__` import `global_interpreter_lock`
 * from `__future__` import `GIL`
 * Not going to happen!
