The history of computers and freedom

Date: Wednesday 8, 2008
Bradley M. Kuhn

In the Beginning
-----------------
    - There were computers
    - There were users
    - ...and users had freedom
    
Ye Old Four freedoms
---------------------
    - To learn
    - To cope and share
    - To modify
    - To share modified versions
    
Then freedom eluded us
-----------------------
    - Software licensing stuff
    - Who invented software licensing?
    - Gates convinced IBM to license rather than acquire DOS
    
Who fixed the problem
---------------------
    - Richard Stallman
    - Lived through the golden age
    - Programmed on old systems

The Golden Age
---------------
    - Academic computer
    - software sharing
    - no licenses
    
MIT AI Lab
------------
    - Discovered that patents == money
    - Spin-offs == $$$
    
GNU
---
    - changed the world
    - For the user of individual computers
    - No reason now not to have freedom on your own machine
    
Internet changes little
------------------------
    - Client/server computer model
    - Freedom implications are basically the same
    - Email example
    
Email: The MTA
---------------
    - Free email software
    - Plenty of proprietary ones
    - RFCs define interoperability
    - We reverse-engineer RFC-less protocols
    
Email: Maul User agents
------------------------
    - Yours has freedom

What changed
--------------
    - The browser delivered applications
    - AJAX made it more powerful
    - Where is computing done?
    - Computing in the cloud
    - Are our freedoms under threat by cloud?
    
Email become gmail
------------------
    - The experience
    - Effectively thin client
    - Mixes up free again: Price vs. Freedom
    - RFCs no longer enough
    - We are back to proprietary "lock-in"
    - Other examples is twitter, amazon cloud, etc
    
Users and the cloud
------------------------
    - Clouds affect us even when we don't really we are using it
    - Richard Stallman is nervous
    
What's the challenge?
------------------------
    - Not merely a question of code and licensing
    - A question of code/data control
    - Power to move code/data/people and transport it to somewhere else
    - Autonomy: of code, data, community
    - Example: Trying to leave Twitter
    
How do we start dealing with this challenge?
------------------------------------------------
    - Plone is GPL which is good
    - Plone is 100% open source
    
Keep going
------------
    - User communities need ability to move
    - Reclaim your data and relocate your community
    - This is **tough** programming

Projects to look at
------------------------
    - **identi.ca (laconi.ca)**: Twitter replacement
    - **Prophet**: Distributed database for web applications
        - Move community via sneakernet, ideal for China
    - Ourselves
        - Affero GPL
            - Extends copyleft to network service world
            - Handles the code side well
        - Techniques to look at:
            - Deployed applications auto-give users source
            - Data is downloadable in community-chunks

Future of the Cloud
------------------------
    - Disjointed but integraed
    - portable
    - Developers decide next direction
    - Ask if we are respecting user's freedoms
    - Data belongs to users, and we are merely custodians
