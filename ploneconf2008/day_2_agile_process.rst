Agile Process by Mike Robinson
==============================

    - Agile is a conceptual framework
    - Agile does have documentation
    - Agile methods have been around since the 1990s and were united by the agile manifesto.
    - Agile empowers the workers
    - Agile knows their finished when they are finished
    - Agile is:
        - Like driving a race car, you know the course but can't account for all the variables
        
Agile Values
----------------
    - Individuals and interactions  > process and tools
    - Working software              > comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration        > contract negotiation
    - Responding to change          > following a plan
    - Planning is more important than plans
    
Agile Principles
----------------
    - **Highest priority is to satisfy the customer**
    - **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.  Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
    - **Deliver working software frequently**.  90% completion is a lie.  Its either not started, working, or finished.  If you do not deliver working software you are of no value.
    - Business people and developers must **work together** daily 
    - Build projects over **motivated people**
    - Give developers the support they need and trust them to **get the job done**
    - **Working software is the primary measure of growth.**
    - Information is best done in **face-to-face conversation**
    - Agile processes promote **sustainable development** by not overworking people to meet deadlines.  
    - The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain constant speed**. 
    - **Simplicity** is really awesome.  Code is a liability to any organization.  The less code you can deliver the better.
    - The best architecture, requirement, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
    - At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective, then **adjusts its behavior accordingly**.
    
Why use agile?
------------------------
    - Agile lets you meet what the marketing folks want to give to customers
    - Agile means good for business so you can plan out hours better
    - Operations likes it because your updates are simpler
    - Development likes it because it empowers developers

Developers need to be respected
-------------------------------
    - Don't agree on schedules without developer input
    - Don't agree on tasks without developer inpit
    - Developers need to be honest in describing what needs to be done
    - Get developers to demo their work to the customer!
    
Charging for the assessment phase
------------------------------------
    - Bill for it
    - Tell customers that you'll bill for planning as long as the customer is willing to pay
    
Roles on a team
------------------------------
    - Product owner: Drives the project
    - Project Manager: Handles the resources
    - Team: Developers
    - Stakeholders: Customers
    - Users: obvious
    
Artifacts
------------
    - Impediment list (use stickies on the wall to be obvious)
    - Project iteration
    - Working code
    
Agile requirements analysis, estimating and planning
--------------------------------------------------------
    - Identify the users
        - Gather requirements from the users via
            - Interviews
            - Questionnaires
            - Observation
            - workshops
        - Ways of documenting
            - Use cases fixed the ATM returning cards after cash
                - too big to plan for and measure with
                - prone to include UI details
            - User stories
                - a tiny bit of information.
                - You can attach these to use cases
        - Estimating development
            - Prediction is difficult!
            - You will never be 100% accurate
            - Short efforts on estimates are accurate
            - Long efforts on estimates are always off
            - Breakdown tasks into manageable chunks
            - Estimation performed by development team
            - Deriving an estimate
                - Expert opinion
                - Analogy
                - Planning poker
            - Story points are a relative measure of size of a story.  10 points is more than 5.
            - Ideal time it would take to complete a task without interruptions.  A football game is 60 ideal minutes and 120 minutes with interruptions
        - Planning poker
            - Each member gets six cards
            - People put the value they think it will take down on the table.  The most common value is how long it will take in story points.
            - If one person has things way off, then talk out why there is a discrepancy
            - After each task has point assigned, figure out how long a point is worth.  Use previous effort to determine the length of a story point.
        - Prioritizing user stories
            - Priority assignment is the primary responsibility of the Product Owner
        - Velocity
            - Measure the rate of progress of a team
            - Amount of story points completed in the last iteration
            - Next iteration = same as last iteration ("yesterday weather")
            - velocity corrects estimation error
            - Accommodate developer optimism
            - Burndown chart
                - Plots the amount of committed effort left against the time left to complete the iteration
