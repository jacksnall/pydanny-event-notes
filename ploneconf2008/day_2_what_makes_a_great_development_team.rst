What is the problem?
====================

From the customer's point of view
------------------------------------

    - Its expensive
    - Its not what they wanted
    - Its unpredictable

From the development team's point of view
--------------------------------------------
    - Its mentally hard
    - Don't feel appreciated for their smarts
    - It is hard work and the hours are often long, inconsistently hard
    - The business doesn't know what they want
    
Requirements
-------------
    - Sometimes not technical enough
    - Sometimes too technical
    
Process is not the answer
----------------------------
    - More control eats up engineer team
    
Technology is not the answer
----------------------------
    - Traditional or service doesn't answer
    
Tools are not the answer
----------------------------
    - trac is not the answer
    
People are the answer
------------------------
    - Great people are what you want
    - Great people need process, technology, tools
    
Different process methods
----------------------------
    - Pick the one you want, it doesn't matter
    - Principles and ethics are what is important
    - Values of the developer

What Mike Robinson thinks will work
===================================

People
-------
    - Change
        - Requirements will shift
        - Scope will migrate
        - Don't think what you know will always work
        - Technology mutates over time
        - The market changes
        - Embrace change!
        - Work in such a way that change does not kill you
            - Think like a sculptor in that you refine things over time
            - Simplicity is king!  If you start complex, it will be harder to enhance later
    - Quality!
        - Do things right
        - Testing early, often, well
        - Are you building the right solution to a problem?
        - Get feedback
    - Commitment
        - Everyone has to be committed
        - Give them sense ownership
        - Make developers feel like what they are doing will make a difference
    - Visibility
        - Let people see what you are doing
        - Give constant status updates
        - Metrics are really important
        - You are either not started, started, or done.  No statements of percentage completes!  No more 90% or 75%
    - Collaboration
        - Get your people into feeling they are part of the team.  
        - That includes developers, managers, testers, etc
    - Focus on Value
        - People need to be told what is considered to be of value
        - Developers need to be instructed as to what parts of what they do will be shown to have value
        - Got to see why what you are doing is important
        - If its not of any use, why do something?
----        

Process
--------
    - How do you pick the right process for your time?
        - No one process is good for all teams.
        - Based on values of your effort, pick the simplest approach to process for your team
    - Review and adapt your process to see if it needs to be altered
    - Evolve your process as needed
