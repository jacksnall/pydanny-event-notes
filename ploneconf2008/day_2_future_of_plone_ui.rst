The future of the Plone UI by Alexander Limi
=============================================

    - Where do we see customers having problems
    
Disclaimer
-----------
    - This is science fiction
    - Not all of it
    - Most of it exists
    - Limi has strong opinions
    - May not reflect what ends up happening

Handy tools
-----------
    - Firebug in Firefox lets you copy xpath to a node
    
Define Skinning
----------------------
    - branding
    - theming
    - customization
    
Need one central registry for templates
--------------------------------------------
    - Deliverance (xdv actually)
    - Handles the skinning process

How does deliverance work?
----------------------------
    - Uses XSLT (which you don't have to know to see)
    - Pulls in content from Plone and replaces it in a static HTML file
    - You don't need to know anything about Plone to work with this!
    
Main focus areas
----------------
    - rich media handling
    - composite pages
    - uploaded content

Simplified UI- Demo
--------------------
    - Get rid of the noise of the edit bar
    - Replace tabs with elegant links
    - putting workflow in-line!
    - Simplifying kupu interface
        - Moving from type centric to a widget centric view of the world
        
Handling of Rich Media
------------------------
    - Attachments of types
    - Portlets/viewlets need to be unified = "widgets"
    - Martin will talk about this after lunch
    - Transformation on save
    
Widgets rock
------------
    - Eleminaes the need for:
        - Collection type
        - Composite page types
        - display menu
        - content proxy types
        - default pages
        - don't need folders anymore
        - folderish needs to go away, we should just call them containers
        
Recent news
------------

        - Evaluating other visual editors
