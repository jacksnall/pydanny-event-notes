Buildout by Clayton Parker
==============================

    - Buildout
        - parts
        - recipes
        - command-line
    - ZopeSkel
        - Custom recipes
    
Why buildout?
--------------
    - because it rocks
    - lets us fetch all the dependencies easily
    - no more ugly checklists
    - lets us put everything involved in setup into one configuration file
    
------    
    
Syntax
--------
    - Variable substitution 
        - ${part:option}
    - option additional and removal
        options = foo bar
        options += foo
        options -= bar
    - Reserved characters
        - :$%{}
        - Don't use those things
    - http-address: 11001 
    - zeo-address: 10001

Parts and Recipes
--------------------
    - Can't have a part without a recip
    - Part is identified in brackets:
        - [plone]
    
Buildout
--------
Some notes about buildout::
    
    [buildout]
        eggs-directory = where to put eggs
        download directory = where to oput downloads
        zope directory = where zope should go 
        index = http://download.zope.org/ppix (for PYPI mirrors)
        
    [instance]
        event-log-level = debug
        
Recipes
--------
Find recipes on...
    - PYPI
    - collective
    
Plone recipes
    - plone.recipe.plone
    - plone.recipe.zope2install
    - plone.recipe.zope2instance
    - plone.recipe.squid
    
plone.recipe.zope2install::

    [zope2]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
    url = ${plone:zope2-url}
    fake-zope-eggs = true
    additional-fake-eggs = ZODB3
    skip-fake-eggs = 
        zope.testing
        zope.component
        zope.i18n

Extending Configuration
--------------------------
    - buildout.cfg
    - profiles
        - base.cfg
        - development.cfg
        - debug.cfg (high debug settings)
        - qa.cfg (testing tools included)
        - prod.cfg (squid, varnish, etc)
        
how to extend::

    [buildout]
    # profile we want to use
    extend = profiles
    
PIL integration!!!
-------------------
doh::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        PILwoTK
        
    [PILwoTK]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    find-links = http://download.zope.org.distribution

Handy tips
--------------
TODO: get all this stuff. Some handy stuff from this talk::

    [instance]
    environment-vars = 
        TZ America/New_York
        
    [debugging]
    parts =
        debug-products
        debug-products-svn
        ipzope
        zope
    eggs =
        plone.reload # real handy for development!!!
        Products.PDBDebugMode
        Products.DocFinderTab
        Products.Clouseau
        Products.PrintingMailHost # sends mailhost messages to console instead of to email!!!
    zcml = 
        plone.reload

Useful command line tools

    - [ipzope]
        - sets up ipython for Zope without the ugliness!!!  Find this full setup!
        - Lots of handy featurs
    
    - [zopepy]
        - Python prompt with all the Zope eggs in it but doesn't start up zope.
        - Great for command-line stuff without the weight
    
Versions.cfg

    - Helps us control versions of everything in one simple file.
    
collective.recipe.zope2cluster

    - Controls instances

Creating recipes
-------------------
$ paster create -t recipe my.recipe.example

Recipe really just consists of::

    class Recipe
        def __init__(sefl,buildout,name,options): pass
        def install(self): pass
        def update(self): pass
        def uninstall(self):pass # find conditions for things
