Roadrunner
----------
    - Plone tax is ugly
    - When you run tests you have to start up everything
    - Use roadrunner for tests!
        - 4 times faster than plain plone
        - Add a recipe to plone buildout
    - Plans
        - Code clean up
        - Auto test
        
Agilito by Gerry kirk
-------------------------
    - The tool that sucks than the rest of them
    - task tracking
    - metrics
        - team dashboard
    - Written in Django 
    - Doesn't do
        - time tracking
        - release planning
        - email notifications

TinyMCE for Plone
--------------------
    - WYSWIG for Plone
    - Can't here the guy
    
Drag-n-drop for KSS
--------------------
    - Small text 
    - looks pretty easy
    - Time box for time tracking.
