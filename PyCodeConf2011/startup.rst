The Many Hats of Building and Launching a Web Startup
=======================================================

* by Tracy Osborn

    * @limedaring
    * Founder of http://weddinginvitelove.com

* Designer not a programmer
* piloshophy: "An entrpeneur tends to bire off a lottle than he can chew hoping he'll quick;y learn how to chew it"
* project is 'ramen profitable'

1. Start off on the Right Foot
==============================

* Have a good amount of money in hand to lesson stress
* Be in good health
* Relationships in good shape
* Quit your job cause you can't do this as a side project

Redefine success
----------------

* Don't try to beat google
* Make your goals modest
* Small goals to begin with

I know HTML! I can program!
----------------------------

* Started in Computer Science but graduated Graphic Design
* Joined a startup as the Designer that grew into a medium sized company
* Got bored
* Wanted to do something that could impact the world

Tried to find a co-founder
------------------------------

* Why weddings?
* Work on something you love to work on
* Cofounders are awesome, but no cofounder is better than the wrong cofounder
* Things didn't go well with the cofounder didn't go well

Did it herself
---------------

* Learn Python The Hard Way (Zed Shaw) **Great programming starter book**
* Got recommended to use Django because of so many apps available 
* Launched weddinglovely.com in 6 weeks!

2. Launch as fast as possible
================================

* Don't try to build giant from the start
* Easy to get discourage
* Everything is going to change once you launch - you can't predict the direction of things
* Take out as many features as possible - add them later if you need them

Work on the hard stuff first
------------------------------

* Programming before HTML layout/design
* Then make it pretty

Active Learning
----------------

* Don't go through a whole book chapter by chapter. Learn the things that work
* http://gigantuan.net
* http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com got mentioned!

Launch with bad code
---------------------

* Don't worry about optimization (speed, caching, code smell, etc)
* get it done!

3. Have a plan for monetization
===================================

* Have at least a vague plan to making money
* Raising money is a pain in the butt

4. Don't be forever alone
===================================

* Network and meet people!

    * Surround yourself with experts (in her case - programming)
    * Marketers
    * Designers
    * find the people who can help you do the work you want to do
    
* NDAs suck

    * Most people won't sign em, so they won't be able to help you with advice
    * Competition isn't necessarily a bad thing

* Ask when you get stuck

    * Don't waste time banging your head against an impossible problem
    * Go ask for help
    
        * Stack Overflow
        * twitter
        * local meetups
    
* Surround yourself with good influences

5. Take Shortcuts
===================

* Skip the hard things if you can, eventually you'll undertand them
* Django is plug & play
