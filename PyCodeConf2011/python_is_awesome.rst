Context for Success
---------------------

 * License
 * Commercial Distributions
 * Zen
 * Community
 * Repository of Modules (PyPI)
 * Killer Apps and Success Stories
 * Win32
 * Books
 
License
--------

 * Most Python releases are GPL-compatible. This makes it free.
 * Going to a closed source language means you are trapped. 
     
Community
---------
    
    * Mailing lists
    * Newsgroups? HA HA HA
    * Python User Groups
    
PyPI
----

    * Repo for Python programming language
    * Over 16,000 packages
    * `pip install ordereddict` works for Python 2.5!
        
Killer apps
------------
    
    * Zope, Django, Pyramid
    * Numpy and Scipy
    * Bittorrent and Twisted
    * YouTube
    * Blender and Maya
    * Win32 - Factoid: Me, @pydanny, has done all his windows programming using cpython and Win32!
        
Easy to learn!
---------------------
    
    * Good teachers.
    * Think how fast you got the types and control structures in Python. General 3 hours
    * In a day you can learn special methods and stdlib
    * Critical because if you need good Python developers it doesn't take long to get up to speed. Converting developers takes:
    
        * C takes 2 years to get competent
        * Java takes 6 months to get competent
        * Python takes a week to get competent
        
    * Rapid development cycle
    
        * Scripting languages are unbeatable for development speed
        * Programs are grown organically
        * Interactive testing lets people work with their code results immediately.
        * Bang out real code fast
            
Economy of expression
---------------------

 * Not many words or characters to get things done.
 * clear English means non-coders can understand your work
 * **Pydanny factoid**: One of the first times I wrote Python on a whiteboard for a boss at NASA/SAIC they thought it was very legible pseudo code representing a complex process.
    
.. sourcecode:: python

    hashmap = {}
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk('.'):
        for filename in files:
            fullname = os.path.join(path, filename)
            with open(fullname) as f:
                d = f.read()
            h = hashlib.md5(d).hexdigest()
            filelist = hashmap.setdefault(h, [])
            filelist.append(fullname)
    pprint.print(hasmap)
            
Beauty Counts
-------------

 * Readability is the #1 mentioned characteristics of why organizations choose Python
 * The beautiful appearance on the page directly affects a programmer's sense of joy
 * Makes us go home and write code
 * If you can read other people's code that makes it easier to maintain
 * Because we all `mostly` share the same idiom it means we can read each other's code. That doesn't stifle creativity - it just means we can get along.
 
    * As a parent I can say I would have *loved* having a formal uniform at school. As a geek in school I would have loved that too. :P

Interactive Prompt (REPL)
----------------------------------------

    * Python experts don't memorize Python
    * They use the interactive prompt often (I try to write tests...)
    * This is a killer features that runs circles around compiled languages
    
        * Python shell
        * IPython 
        * BPython (My favorite)

Behind the Scenes
------------------

Philosophy of core dev

 * Conservative growth
 * `We read Knuth so you don't have to`
 * Aim for simple implementation
 
Protocols
----------

To interact with these we have defined protocols

 * DBAPI
 * Hashlib
 * Compression
 * WSGI for the web
 * Conversion protocols

Specifics of Python: The Foundation
------------------------------------

 * Dictionaries and Lists
 * Automatic memory management
 * Overridable syntax
 * Exceptions
 * **You can reprogram the brackets?**
 * **And we can reprogram the dot?!?**
 
Winner Language Feature: Iterator Protocol
------------------------------------------------

 * High level glue that holds the language together
 * Iterables: strings, lsits, sets, dicts, collections, files, open urls, csv readers, itertools
 * Um... I know this. I've had to construct these on my own in other languages. But not Python... Wow - I just realized this just now.
 * List comprehensions give us joy
 * List generators are amazing. No one else has them
 
.. sourcecode:: python

    # When Raymond wrote **sorted** he wasn't thinking about sets
    # But they still just works
    sorted(set('abracadabra'))
    sorted(set(open(filename))
    sorted(set(open(filename))

Winner Language Feature: Generators
--------------------------------------------

 * Serious magic
 * A million rows in a generators is nothing
 * Simple syntax to do them. You only need the YIELD keyword.

Winning language Decorators
------------------------------

 * Expressive
 * Easy on the eyes
 * Works for functions, methods, and classes
 * **Factoid**: I have problem writing them. Serious problems. :'(

Winning Language Features: exec, eval, type
--------------------------------------------

 * Not a fan of `exec` and `eval` because when used in my experience they are done badly
 * But `type` is awesome
 
Winning Language Feature: With Statement
------------------------------------------

    * Clean, elegant resource management: threads, locks. etc
    * Important tool for factoring code
    * Contains the setUp and tearDown code.
    * The reverse of functions

Winning Language Feature: Abstract Base Classes
--------------------------------------------------

 * TODO - go over this one
 
Winning Language Feature: Indentation 
--------------------------------------------------

 * Makes the code really clear
 * We write our pseudo code this way
 * Less errors!
 * Less ambiguity!
