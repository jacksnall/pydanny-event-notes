Story of PyPy
================

* psyco was JIT python

    * Managing it was hard
    * hardcoded for 32 bit CPUs and we are on 64 bit
    * Any changes to core Python killed pysco
    
* Years ago created a Python interpreter inside of Python

    * 2000x slower than cpython
    * ran on restricted Python (**r-python**)

Why you should use PyPy
