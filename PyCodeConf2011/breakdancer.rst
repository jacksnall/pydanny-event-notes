Testing is a boring subject
============================

* How do you find those edge cases?
* How do you detect crazy pairs of edge cases?
* Wait until there is a reported error?

Wrote a framework to help set tests
====================================

* Actions are the tests
* Drivers performs the tests and include specific conditions
* So that means your tests are independent of the conditions but defined in code?

.. note:: Seems like a design of separation of presentation from content in tests!!! MVC anyone?
