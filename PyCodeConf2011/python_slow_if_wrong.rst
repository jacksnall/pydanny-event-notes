Easiest way to do Python wrong
================================

tight inner loops
-------------------

.. sourcecode:: python


    chars = open.file('file').read()
    for char in chars:
        ...
        # slow
        
Speeding things
-----------------

    * Use regexes and c modules
    * No such thing as 100% pure python
    * forget about swig
    
        * writing C modules is easy and integrating them easy too .. note:: I want to learn how to do this
        * swig is a code generator for C++
        
    * python + C is so far the winning combination
    * C is simple; Python is simple; PyPy is hard .. note:: Thisis his statement not mine.
