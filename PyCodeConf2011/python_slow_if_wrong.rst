Python is Only Slow If You Use it Wrong

    * But this talk has nothing to do with them
    * If you apply to google and say his name he get's money. :)

* Trying to talk about bitter


Stuff he's done
=================

* bup: Python software doing massive things for real problems

* sshuttle: VPN software tht handles 802..11 g/n speeds in python

Easiest way to do Python wrong
================================

tight inner loops
---------------------------------

.. sourcecode:: python


    chars = open.file('file').read()
    for char in chars:
        ...
        # slow
        
* Don't do this
* Apparently for dynamically typed languages, this is a very, very slow operation
        
Speeding things up
------------------

* Use regexes and c modules
* No such thing as 100% pure python
* forget about swig

    * writing C modules is easy and integrating them easy too 
    * swig is a code generator for C++
    
* python + C is so far the winning combination
* C is simple; Python is simple; PyPy is hard

    * The concept behind PyPy is really hard
    * Python and C are relatively straightforward compared to the concepts of PyPy
        
.. note:: I want to learn how to write C and then add it to my Python work.

Other way to do things wrong
================================

* Computation threads

    * Worthless becauxe of GIL
    
* Threads are okay for I/O
* fork() works great for both
* C modules that use threads are fine

Garbage Collection
