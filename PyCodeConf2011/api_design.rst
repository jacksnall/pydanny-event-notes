Philosophy
========================

We share a dark part:

 * PHP
 * Java
 * ColdFusion
 
We all love the Zen of Python::

    >>> import this
    
Bits:

* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better then implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* If the implementation is hard to explain, its a bad idea (unless you are PyPy)
* There should be one and only one way to do things

Playing with the Github API
============================

TODO: Get Ruby example from his slides. Ruby makes this easy

How do we do this in Python?
------------------------------

 * Pick the right std lib http/url/lib/2
 
TODO: Show the the example Python code from Confessions that I stole from Kenneth. :)
