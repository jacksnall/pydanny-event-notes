* If you are building a startup you are trying to replace the big companies you dislike. The big companies started the same way you did, as a way to break the current system.

* We want to build the next big companies by mastering the disciplines of entrepreneurship.

* Ronald Reagan is the godfather of the 'Open Data Initiatives Program'!
* GPS grew out of this system which has provided billions of dollars of business

.. note:: Sunlight Labs (http://sunlightlabs.com/) is a group that works to translate the often **not-machine** readable data into formats that can be read and used by machines (and hence entrepreneurs).

Todd is working on...
-------------------------------

* See RFPEZ to get through government RFPs faster (find on GitHub)
* US government spends $80 billion on IT per year. Needs to be cheaper!

    * This is why OpenStack (http://www.openstack.org) was started at NASA by Chris Kemp. It was to reduce cost of single server setup from tens of thousands of dollars (mostly labor costs for meetings to discuss setting up single machines) to the same cloud costs paid for Amazon AWS. I can tell you as an ex-NASA employee that server provisioning was overly expensive as of 2010.
    * US Government runs 24,000 websites. How are they all done?

* Getting your health records from the US government without pain.
