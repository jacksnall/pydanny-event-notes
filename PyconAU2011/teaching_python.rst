Challenges
----------

* Laptops issued to students are so locked down the students can't install programming languages

    * They use silverlight
    * The also use a JavaScript version of Python

* *Sometimes the level of knowledge from some of the students can be both intimidating and discouraging.*

Teaching CS in Australia
------------------------

* Not enough people are teaching programming in high school
* We're doing a good job of supporting students who already know how to program
* The students who start out with nothing, have a (very) hard time catching up.
