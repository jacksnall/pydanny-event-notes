Raymond Hettiger
------------------

LA's own Raymond Hettiger talked about `What makes Python Awesome?`

    * Other languages are awesome, how is Python better?
    * Most Python releases are GPL-compatible. This makes it free.
    * Going to a closed source language means you are trapped.
    * Commercial distributions like ActiveState and Enthought
    * Python has Zen. Internalized as core developers and internalized by community devs
    * Community
    
        * Mailing lists
        * Newsgroups? HA HA HA
        * Python User Groups
    
    * PyPI
    
        * Repo for Python programming language
        * Over 16,000 packages
        * `pip install ordereddict` works for Python 2.5!
        
    * Killer apps
    
        * Zope, Django, Pyramid
        * Numpy and Scipy
        * Bittorrent and Twisted
        * YouTube
        * Blender and Maya
        * Win32 - Factoid: Me, @pydanny, has done all his windows programming using cpython and Win32!
        
    * Easy to learn!
    
        * Good teachers.
        * Think how fast you got the types and control structures in Python. General 3 hours
        * In a day you can learn special methods and stdlib
        * Critical because if you need good Python developers it doesn't take long to get up to speed. Converting developers takes:
        
            * C takes 2 years to get competent
            * Java takes 6 months to get competent
            * Python takes a week to get competent
            
        * Rapid development cycle
        
            * Scripting languages are unbeatable for development speed
            * Programs are grown organically
            * Interactive testing lets people work with their code results immediately.
            * Bang out real code fast
