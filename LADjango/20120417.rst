All lightning talks. I was going to give one but was too busy to finishing assembling my talk.

Talk #1 - Deploying Django with wsgi and nginx

by Michael Avila

Two things hard in computer science
------------------------------------

* Caching invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. -- Phil Karlton
