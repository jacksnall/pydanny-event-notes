Lightning Talks Thursday
================================

.. note:: I rarely take this many notes on Lightning Talks these days. (Danny 07/05/11)

Plone HRM
==============

.. note:: Kind of neat and the sort of thing a Plone CMS might handle well. You need tons of docs plus some core tools. Add in `PloneFormGen` and you've got a pretty nice HR tool. (Danny 07/05/2011)

 - Human Resources Product
 - Handles different locations
 - Functionality
 
    - Salary
    - Contract Builder
    - Performance Reviews 

Quills
==============

.. note:: This is a tool that lets you turn your Plone site into a blog farm. (Danny 07/05/2011)

 - Blogging for Plone
 - Not ready but BOF is happening

GoReplace
==============

 - SmartFolders + Regular Expressions
 - Looks good

appy.pod
=========


 -Turns Plone items into PDF, Docs, RTF, and other things

Interop-Kmap
==============

 - Semantic indexing and semantic search of documents/contents
 - Hard to understand 

Grok
==============

.. note:: This is about the `simple` Zope powered framework. The work Chris McDonough did on repoze.BFG / Pyramid that eclipsed it clearly eclipsed it in both design strategy and leveraging lessons learned from outside the community. (Danny 07/05/2011)

 - Luciano Ramalho
 - Simple is good
 - Start playing with it now

Manage your releases with Bundleman
==========================================

.. note:: Even back then this seemed like a duplication of where the rest of the community was doing with buildout. However, the notes I have from this period claim 'Good Documentation', something that can be argued was a failure of the buildout community.

 - Handy management tool for releases
 - Ties right into SVN
 - Used to manage externals.  *I think I like builtout better.*
 - Good for maintaining older applications perhaps
 - Good documentation
 - http://public.dev.nuxeo.com/~ben/bundleman/

Repoze: Getting Plone to WSGI
===============================

 - Paul Everitt
 - WSGI, Eggs, Paste, virtualenv
 - Advice: Record your coding, don't do it live

Storage for Archetypes with SQLAlchemy
==========================================

 - Godefried Chapelle
 - Good logging

Entransit Content Deployment, bridging the presentation gap
=============================================================

 - Alan Runyan
 - Gives human users the ability to design and light data architecture
 - Empowers end users
 - Can control page layouts
