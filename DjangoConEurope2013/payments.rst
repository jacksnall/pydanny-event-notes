The Mozilla Marketplace is the app store for Firefox OS and this Django powered site takes payments from users. 

Combined with issues like localisation, identity and scale - we are processing payments through Django. This talk will cover the marketplace, the architecture of the system and how we cope with all the paranoia.

Who should be paranoid?
========================

Everyone should be paranoid:

    * Developers
    * Users
    * banks
    * Everyone
