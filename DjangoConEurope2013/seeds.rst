This talk will be an in-depth review of the stages that most open source projects go though, and the decisions their maintainers face. Requests will be used as an example â€” lessons learned and best practices will be covered.

Once upon a time...
======================

The Facebook SDK Python library

    * Facebook rarely updated it
    * Became unworkable
    * People complained, got on Hacker News
    * Disabled comments

Now replaced by http://pythonforfacebook.com

Public Source Projects
=======================

* Company open sources code
* Doesn't maintain it: motivations are unclear
* Really sucks for users of the code

On the other hand.. Gittip!
==============================

* Platform for sustainable development
* Everything is open source, including internal discussions, interviews with media, etc
* Everything is an issue
* Major decisions are voted on github.
* Interviewed with journalists are live-streamed

Shared Investments
====================

* Shared ownership, extreme transparency
* New contributors get involved by following a documented process
* Low risk. High bus-factor
* See also: Python, Django, Firefox, jQUery...
