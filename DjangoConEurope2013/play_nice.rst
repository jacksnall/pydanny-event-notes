Play nice with others

I go through the various tools and techniques that we use to make our Django apps easily reusable across sites and environments with different requirements on data being stored, business logic and backends that enable us to have one set of apps that we deploy over and over and just easily plug in the part that is different in each case without sacrificing clarity or ease of development.

All tools and approaches are used in production and are open source.
