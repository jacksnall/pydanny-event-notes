Circus: process & socket manager
====================================

* By Tarek Ziade

    * Works for Mozilla
    * 

Circus is a process manager we developped at Mozilla while working on high scalability, we wanted to have a way to deal with our processes directly from python, and in a better way that's what possible with the standard library.

Circus uses zeromq in its internals, and thus is easily extensible. We'll present you how you why we built circus, how to use it and some core concepts that were useful in the conception of the tool. Also, we'll demonstrate how easy it is to plug circus with a Django stack.

Typical Django Deployment
==============================

* Nginx > Gunicon > Django + sentry + celery


Supervisord is frequently used for management of these components. Alternatives include:

*  Bluepill (less mature)
* upstart (system level - root access needed)
* daemontools (low-level like upstart)
* got, monit, runit, etc.

Missing features from supervisord
==================================

* Realtime stdout/stderr
* realtme stats
* powerful web console
* Remote access
* clustering
* event-based plugins

Since those were missing, Tarek launched his own project: Circus!

Technical choices for Circus
=============================

* Python 
* PSUTIL
* ZeroMQ
* TODO - get rest of this

The Core: psutil
==================

Third-party library that is easy to use and pretty elegant:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import psutil
    >>> p = psutil.Process(7384)
    >>> p.name
    'Address book'
    
    >>> p.uids
    user
    
The Messenger: ZeroMQ
======================

* async library for message passing == smart socket
* highly scalable
* transports: ITC, IPC, TCP, PGM (multicast)
* principal patterns

    * request
    * pub/sub
    * push/pull

* used by IPython
* PyZMG - zmq bind + nice I/O event loop adapted from Tornado

Circus Architecture
