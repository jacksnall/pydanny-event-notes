First Keynote: On the Revolutions
=================================

* by Brandon Rhodes

Topic: Nichola Kopernik 
------------------------

* Polish Astronomer
* Lifted the **Earth** into the **heavens**, rather than the Earth was at the bottom of the heavens.
* Lived: 


Near-Earth environment
-------------------------

* 300s BC - Aristotle - spherical Earth
* 200s BC - Erathosthenes - radius of Earth
* 100s BC - Hipparchus - distance to Moon

Hard to tell how things worked out
------------------------------------

* Planets move slowly across the sky
* Retrograde motion
* Didn't make sense, so Ptolomy came up with a sophisticated way of handling this based off of observations.
* People followed this for thousands of years because it matched empirical evidence.
* It was the lack of evidence against Ptolomy that made the case against Galileo.

Kopernik debated Ptolomy
-------------------------

Kopernik read:

* Galileo
* Kepler's ellipses
* Newton theories

Bradley in 1725 proved Kopernik
-----------------------------------

* Stellar aberration
* Speed of light
* Watched the stars move in relation to the Earth's movement

.. epigraph::

    "It took 1,900 years after the Greeks discovered the distance to the moon for us to determine the distance to a star."
