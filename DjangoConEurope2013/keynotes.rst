First Keynote: On the Revolutions
=================================

* by Brandon Rhodes

Topic: Nichola Kopernik 
------------------------

* Polish Astronomer
* Lifted the **Earth** into the **heavens**, rather than the Earth was at the bottom of the heavens.
* Lived: 


Near-Earth environment
-------------------------

* 300s BC - Aristotle - spherical Earth
* 200s BC - Erathosthenes - radius of Earth
* 100s BC - Hipparchus - distance to Moon

Hard to tell how things worked out
------------------------------------

* Planets move slowly across the sky
* Retrograde motion
* Didn't make sense, so Ptolomy came up with a sophisticated way of handling this based off of observations.
* People followed this for thousands of years because it matched empirical evidence.
* It was the lack of evidence against Ptolomy that made the case against Galileo.

Kopernik debated Ptolomy
-------------------------

Kopernik read:

* Galileo
* Kepler's ellipses
* Newton theories

Bradley in 1725 proved Kopernik
-----------------------------------

* Stellar aberration
* Speed of light
* Watched the stars move in relation to the Earth's movement

.. note::

    "It took 1,900 years after the Greeks discovered the distance to the moon for us to determine the distance to a star." -- Brandon Rhodes
    
Why did Kopernik debate all the physical evidence for the Earth-centric universe?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Beauty
* Wanted better math
* Made the code pretty

.. note::

    "Kopernik made the most awesome code refactor in history."  -- Brandon Rhodes
    
Kopernik's model of the solar system made it clear that the Sun was the center of the solar system instead of yet another object.

TODO - get Brandon's code models for the Ptolomic and Kopernik solar system models.

Copernican Refactor
--------------------

Brandon's new term for any refactor that brings things to the center.

Example: Gadgets that combine automobile cigarette lighters with a USB connector to put power into mobile devices.

* Clean Architecture (http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
* Docopt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docopt)
* Django (compared to Python CGI)
