In the world of programming nothing is more irritating than the "artist". Programmers who are all "front-end", business guys who are all "ideas", and designers who can't draw. I say real programmers don't need to be artists. Rather, a programmer needs to have the skills necessary to take their imagination (or other people's) and translate it into working software.

This talk will contain many of my secrets for turning ideas I have in my mind into real things. I will lean heavily on the arts, music, and writing, but ultimately this talk will be about implementing software. There will be no fluffy spirituality or hand waving in this talk, just real tricks to help you make stuff.
