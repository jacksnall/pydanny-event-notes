Having Your Pony and Committing It Too
==========================================

by Jacob Burch

For many years before 2012, the topic at the tip of every argument-seeking tongue at Django Conferences was ""when is Django going to get on Github?"" Getting the core framework on the social coding site was the first stride in breaking down the barriers to having anyone and everyone not only having a pony, but getting it into core too. Now that this important step is almost a year in, just how easy is it to take the step from end-user to core-contributor? Delightfully Easy.

So easy, that I'll be breaking every rule I know in giving a talk and actually attempting to get a feature from idea, to code, to request, to a live haggle-and-debate session with core contributors in-audience, to pull request to (hopefully!) merge all within 30 minutes. Advice from a variety previous contributors on will be provided throughout the demonstration, including tips for getting very small bugs fixed quickly to strategies for getting necessary groundswell for larger full-feature ideas.
