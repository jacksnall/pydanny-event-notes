Have you been using JavaScript more and more when building your web applications? Are you implementing REST API frequently? If so, you have probably realised that server-side generated content is no longer enough to provide cutting edge user experience.

I would like to show you how to avoid jQuery callback hell and how to gain more flexibility using MVC on the client side. I will introduce tools for managing modules in JavaScript and will teach you how to become more productive with CoffeeScript. I will share my experience of integrating Django and sophisticated JavaScript stack from two points of view: RESTful API and static files management. Let the trip begin!


Basics
=======

* Django
* Javascript via Coffeescript


Javascript framework considerations
========================================

* Backbone didn't do enough

    * Lack of binding mechanism
    * no reusable views
    * Models are poor

* Backbone & Marionette helped but they were still unhappy
* Angular, very nice
* Ember, very nice

How to use Javascript framework with Coffeescript?
======================================================

* Use requireJS with extra plugins

    * Coffeescript painless integration
    * modular code
    * builder
    * uglifier
    
Tools for building JS apps in Django
=====================================

* django-compressor
* django-pipeline
* django-require

Django & APIs for JS apps
==========================

* django-piston was too long in the tooth
* django-tastypie had an uncomfortable amount of boilerplate
* django-rest-framework was just right.
