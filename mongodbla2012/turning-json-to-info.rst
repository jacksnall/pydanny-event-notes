========================
Turning JSON into info
========================

by Roger Bodamer

.. note:: Did not show the query code. I have to look it up online. Ugh.

Relative Queries
=================

* 2 aggregations at the same time

    * 1 by user
    * 1 by location

* Break up into several queries
* Fairly complex
* Easiest in Python or other programming languages

A note on queries
==================

* There is no notion of declared schema
* The augmented scheme is coded in queries
* Reuse is very hard, happens at a query language

A word on rendering graphs and reports
================================================

* Some libraries

    * Gruff
    * Scruffy
    * HighCharts (Paid for)
    * JRafael
    * JQuery Vizualize
    * MooCharts
    
Services:

    http://getgauag.es
    
* But basically you have to know how to program

Punchlines
============

* Fluid requirements are what you get to handle when you use MongoDB
* Know how to program Python (or anything else)
* If you are a business analyst, you're screwed (Not an acceptable answer)
