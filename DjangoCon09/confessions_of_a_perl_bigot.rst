Confessions of a Perl bigot
===========================

by Frank Wiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Old Django dude who does a lot of Perl

 * Don't flame him
 * We want dynamically typed, garbage collected languages
 
Afraid to give up his addiction to Perl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Didn't want to give up his expertise
 * Lazy and did not want to learn
 
Outside observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * urlconf uses regex
 * Quality of his code supply is better
 * Good documetation
 * Lots of modules that don't install right
 * Hands don't hurt as much because pinkies aren't used to grab the shift and obscure things
 * Seeing lots of startups using Rails and Django

Perl thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Perl is a very insular community. Not as many blogs and articles in the modern methods
 * Django is moving upwards. Not yet stuck with legacy issues
 
What is Django missing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Centralized repo a'la CPAN. `We do have pypi.` 
 * Perl has more HOWTO type docs and blog posts on various topics. `Pymotw is a good example of what we need.`
 * Dedicated Q&A website. Such as Perlmonks.org
 * Centralized user groups structure
 * Shared community hosting/infrastructure. `Don't we have webfaction?`
 
Advice on having a Django addiction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Just say yes.
 * Best of breed.
 * Development speed versus app performance
 * Right level of coupling
