Pros:

    * Patches
    * People trust you most because they can see the code
    * BSD license

Cons:

Lessons Learned
================

 * Think about your URLs. Really hard
 
    * Adding versions was hard

 * Lay your project out sanely
 
    * started with no tests
    * Shoved code in
    * Racked up a lot of technical debt
    * worked hard to make the project layout a bit more sane

 * Write tests!
 
    * Had a complicated code base without tests
    * They have hosted continuous integration
