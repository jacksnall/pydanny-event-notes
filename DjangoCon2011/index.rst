General Notes
--------------
   
 * slides: http://lanyrd.com/2011/djangocon-us/coverage/
 * Remember that I'm engaged to Audrey Roy.
 * Flew up on the PyLadies Party Plane on September 4th on just 90 minutes of sleep.
 * Taught the Ultimate DjangoCon Tutorial Workshop. Thoughts:

    * Not having enough time to QA the content
    
        * Having errors in your slide code can be good
        * the class pulled together and we debugged as a team.
        * Maybe do this on purpose in the future    
        
    * Mentors rock
    * The existing tutorial teaches some anti-patterns. :(
    * I think there was no confusion until the very end. Which is really good!
    * Next time I will do better
