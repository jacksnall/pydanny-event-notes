Intro to caching
====================

 * Caching is post-process data
 * Stored in a key/value store
 * Usually Done to:
 
    * Speed up your app
    * Lesson load on third party apps

Jacob's rule of architecture
------------------------------

 * No rules only principals
 * Start with assumptions/advice
 * Benchmark/inspect before you break principals
 
Ask some questions
------------------

 * Do you really need caching? Caching adds...
 
    * complexity
    * additional point of failure
    
 * Modern database are stupidly optimized
 
    * May be all you need!
