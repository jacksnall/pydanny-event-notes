Why the Django Documentation Sucks

 * All documentation sucks because the mind of the writer can't match the mind of the reader
 * Use cases mostly appear to be "I want to know about X"
 * **contention** Documentation wasn't necessarily done with use cases in mind
 * No pictures? **A picture is worth a thousand words**
 
    * Some people need visual pictures to process things - visual thinkers
