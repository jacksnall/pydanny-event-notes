Fireside Chat with a BDFL
=========================

Moderated by Sean O'Conner and starring **Jacob Kaplan-Moss**

How did Django get started?
============================

 * 2002 - 2003 LJ World hired Adrian Holovaty to become their dedicated Web Developer
 
 * Previous to 2002 had Frank Wiles making things for them in Perl
 * Adrian hired Simon Willison as the most overqualified intern until Alex Gaynor
 * Because of the fast news cycle at a newspaper you don't have the luxuries of other jobs.
 * Sometimes you have to build a project within 24 hours
 * Adrian and Simon decided to do it all in Python
 * The Python ecosphere didn't have all the tools they needed so they made things up
 
    * Zope/Plone couldn't cut it
    * No light frameworks existed
    
 * At PyCon 2005 they went to a success story workshop and Adrian demonstrated a blog in 5 minutes

    * Nothing else in Python could do it at the time
    * People asked them to open source it
    * LJ World was okay with open sourcing it
    
 * In July 2005 they released it as open source


Why did Django get traction and other light Python frameworks didn't?
====================================================================================

 * Luck of timing
 * They did a lot more documentation than any other emerging option

    * Jacob and Adrian focused on the on-boarding of incoming developers
    * Good input from Wilson Minor on design and the result was that it looked better than it's competitors

 * Spent a lot of time considering how the community ought to be built

How has Django's community and structure has changed?
=====================================================

 * Jacob mentions their are 6 developer journalists. The reality is that there are a lot more
 * Linear community growth until 2006 and then it's grown exponentially
 * 20,000 members on the mailing list
 * **Huge issue**: Not enough man hours for the leadership to increase the number of contributors.
 
What about Django 2.0?
======================

 * Jacob never wants to have a **not backwards** compatible version of Python
 * Doesn't want to see Django 1.11, wants to go Django 2.0 at that point
 * Massive incompatible rewrites are really challenging

Wishlist?
=========

 * Wants to see a better job for formalizing the app interface
 * Wants to see Django become a micro-kernel.
 
    * Less features and more APIs and hooks
    * No more features in Django
    
 * Delighted that **Python Package** has been shaped by the Django community!
 * Wants to see more people empowered to help build Django

How can Django can become a better part of the Python community?
================================================================

 * 2 years ago the communities were a bit separate
 * Some tension caused by Django because we as a community sometimes get aggressive
 * Some tension caused by Python because the anti-establishment guys don't like winners
 * Django needs to help push for better Packaging in python
 * Let's port to Python 3!

.. note:: I think having the Django community cook up a good alternative to PIL and make it pure Python.

In your role as BDFL have you had to go against the community?
==============================================================

 * Jacob/Adrian admit being wrong about the template language not auto-escaping
 * Doesn't want to overlord too much
