Presentation is important
============================

 * Polixh front-end is as important as the front end

    * It may "scale"
    
    * But bloated markup and JavaScript will slow things
    
 * The implementation really matters
 
Start Organized
================

 * Structure the templates
 * Template Tags should express presentation, not logic 
 
.. notes:: I wish people remembered this bullet about template tags and logic
