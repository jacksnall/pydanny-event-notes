 * You might lose customers and users

What does he want
==================

 * Multilingual content in the database
 * Editable in a usable admin inteface
 * Easy, Django-like API
 * Good performance
 
    * Most of the existing tools are slow
    * Bad performance
    
State of now
=============

 * 10 packages at http://djangopackages.com/
 * No consensus on how this should be done
 
    * API
    * Base solutions
    * many ideas floating around
    
Approaches
===========

 * 1 table, 1 extra field
 * 1 extra table with key/value translations
 * 2 tables, one for translated fields one for translated fields (dual-table) - **How I've done it**
 * Translations serialized into a single field (Pickle/JSON) - **No search without a ton of hacking!!!**
 * gettext
 * Google Translate
