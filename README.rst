pydanny-event-notes
===================

This is where I accumulate and store notes and slides and other content gotten at events, meetups, classes, tutorials, and conferences over the years. 

This is a work in progress. What you see here on github is partially rendered with some enhancements at http://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org.
