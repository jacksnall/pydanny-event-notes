Bringing down the system using Python to save lives
======================================================

* By Randall Degges

The issue
----------

* Syrian Uprising
* Military killing civilians

What can I do to help?
------------------------------

* Shut down military communications!

BUT HOW?!?

F@#$ the government!
----------------------

* Syrian military monitoring civilian communications then dropping bombs
* How to protect people fighting a terrible regime?
* Shut down the system!

Using Voip to save lives
---------------------------------

* Use Asterisk and pycall to make millions calls
* just a few bytes to make the call

Why Pyramid?
===============

* By Michael R
* CTO of http://cars.com
* Known on IRC as 'goodwill'

---------

What Pyramid doesn't do
-------------------------

* Make choices for you

Features
--------

* Creates a WSGI-compliant application

* views, requests, and more
* Awesome t-shirt
* Works with gevent for asynchronous behavior

Example
--------

.. sourcecode:: python

    from paste.httpserver import serve
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    from pyramid.response import Response
    
    def hello_world(request):
        return Response('Hello, World!')
        
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        config = Configurator()
        config.add_view(hello_world)
        app = config.make_wsgi_app()
        serve(app, host='127.0.0.1')

.. note:: Finish rest of sample app

Boilerplate available
-----------------------------

* Libraries
* Scaffolding (see http://pyramid.opencomparison.org/categories/application-scaffolding/)
* FormAlchemy can do roughly what Django admin
