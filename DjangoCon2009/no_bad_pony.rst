How is pony formed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Russell said pony about a silly requirement request
 * Cal Henderson said he wanted a magic pony

Bad pony is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * ideas that are just plain wrong (not following pep 8, stupidity)
 
 * impractical ideas (problems that don't exist, changes design contracts, architecture astronauting)
 
 * Design mismatch (DTL to Jinja, ORM with SQLAlchemy, test framework with Nose)
 
   * Ignores the philosophy (Add GROUP BY HAVING to ORM, Add variables/callables to template language, Add AJAX to forms)
   
   * Just a setting (less is good)
   
   * Wrong direction (feature creep, make dev server multithreaded, add connection pooling)
   
   * Add a backend (more work, hard to test, they provide APIs anyway)
   
 * The community
 
   * The core doesn't have to do everything
   
   * In fact, the core can't do anything
   
   * Community has an essential role
   
   * Blessing by core doesn't make code better
   
 * Add X to contrib
 
   * django-comments
 
   * django-tagging
   
 * Process ponies
 
   * write more blog posts
   
   * have a weekly news summary
   
   * have a nightly tarball download
   
   * Have a continuous build
   
   * Have a precompiled PDF documentation
