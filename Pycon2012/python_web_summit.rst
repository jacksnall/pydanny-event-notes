* Panels are important, but take people aside if need be



Creating a Better Deployment Story
=====================================

**Moderated by Jacob Kaplan-Moss (Django DBFL)**

Panelists:

* Tarek Ziadé (MDistribute/Packaging)
* Nate Aune (DjangoZoom, Appsembler)

    * All tools (Plone, Django) makes it hard to do deployments. Hence his deployment startup (DjangoZoom)

* Kenneth Reitz (Heroku)

    * pip needs to be able to set versions of Python
    * PyPI needs more attention

* Ian Bicking (Paste/WebOb/Silver Lining)

    * Let's create a formal Application Package specification.
    * Problem to overcome is the difference between developers and sys admin

* Jim Fulton (Buildout/Zope)

    * Company does development and maintains 500 applications
    * "Packaging needs to be better so we can deploy more easily."


Questions
---------

#. How come Java .war files do it better than Python?
#. What is the status quo?
#. What are people working on to make this better?

Formal Application Package Specification?
------------------------------------------

Ian Bicking's thought on how to do it. Would have these things::
    
    Formal path specification
    Formal dependency listings
    Project description
    Python version labeling
    Include non-Python components (database, libraries, etc)
