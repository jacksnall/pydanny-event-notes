During the summit
-----------------

* Panels are important, but take people aside if need be



Creating a Better Deployment Story
=====================================

**Moderated by Jacob Kaplan-Moss (Django DBFL)**

Panelists:

* Tarek Ziadé (Distribute/Packaging)

    * New distutils lets you specify versions of third-party packages. But... redhat and other OS tools have their own package names. Ugh.

* Nate Aune (DjangoZoom, Appsembler)

    * All tools (Plone, Django) makes it hard to do deployments. Hence his deployment startups (DjangoZoom and Appsembler).
    * We need to come up with a standard and insist on using it.

* Kenneth Reitz (Heroku)

    * pip needs to be able to set versions of Python
    * PyPI needs more attention

* Ian Bicking (Paste/WebOb/Silver Lining)

    * Let's create a formal Application Package specification.
    * Problem to overcome is the difference between developers and sys admin

* Jim Fulton (Buildout/Zope)

    * Company does development and maintains 500 applications
    * "Packaging needs to be better so we can deploy more easily."


Questions
---------

#. How come Java .war files do it better than Python?
#. How do we make it so that Python is as easy to deploy to the web as PHP.
#. What is the status quo?
#. What are people working on to make this better?

Formal Application Package Specification?
------------------------------------------

Ian Bicking's thought on how to do it. Would have these things::
    
    Formal path specification
    Formal dependency listings
    Project description
    Python version labeling
    Include non-Python components (database, libraries, fortran, etc)
    
Jacob's comment: Is this going down the route of Chef/Puppet?

Namespacing Distributions
---------------------------

* Tarek as to play namespacing games to make sure that we get to use DistUtils backporting across versions of Python.     

* Armin Ronacher commented: "*The fact that having the same package name for distutils2/packaging would be a problem shows the root of the issue: no proper version deps.*"

Takeaways
---------

* Force deployed applications be a package.
* Formal application specification?
* Specify Python versions in virtualenv/buildout
* The challenge of dealing with vendor named projects
