EuroPython 2013
=====================================

:venue: Florence, Italy
:dates: July 1 - July 7

.. note:: The first day of the conference we were asked to give a 3-hour tutorial. We put something together in 48 hours, but that means I didn't get many notes in. Nevertheless, it's been a great conference. :-)
