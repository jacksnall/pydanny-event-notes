Intro
======

* ipython is an awesome tool for teaching
* But could do things better

Teaching Physics
=================

* Physics is considered hard by students

    * What is the use?
    * ElectroMagnetics is abstract
    * What is a field?
    * How do semiconductors work?
    
What's good about ipython notebook?
====================================

* Great tool
* Feels lightweight
* Like MatLab in a browser that starts counting at zero!

Physics extension
------------------

* Adds physical quantities
* Adds physical constants
* Enables check if Units match
* Started by: ``%load_ext physics``

How do you make physics interesting?
-------------------------------------

* Use real life examples demonstrated in ipython notebook
* Be exciting and fun

Experiment
-----------

* Introduce ipython as an online calculator
* Show that it can use units
* Extend by adding small functions
* Introduce plotting
