Countering

* Misuse

Different Databases, different occasions

* Types of databases:

    * Relational
    * Document
    * Key-value
    * Graph
    * Object / Heirarchial
    * Spatial
    * Time-series / RRD
    * Search

    * PostgreSQL
    * MySQL
    * SQLite

* Document

    * MongoDB
    * CouchDB

Some quick theory
==================

* ACID

    * *A*tomicity
    * *C*onsistency
    * *I*solation
    * *D*urability
    
* CAP Theorem (you can only have 2 of the 3 of them)

    * **C**onsistency
    * **A**vailability
    * **P**artition Tolerance
