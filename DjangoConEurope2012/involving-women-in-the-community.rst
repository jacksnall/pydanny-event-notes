"I don't think we should care that much, because if we care too much then the problem gets bigger."

* "Hire anyone because they are smart, not because of gender."

.. note:: YES! If you are having trouble finding developers, hire smart people regardless of their race, gender, creed, etc and train them up.

* "I have a game: Any time someone says, 'Women tend to' or 'Men tend to', interrupt them and yell 'BULLSHIT!'"

.. note:: Brilliant! I'm going to play this game.
