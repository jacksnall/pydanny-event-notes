============================================================

"I don't think we should care that much, because if we care too much then the problem gets bigger."

.. note:: Cause if you ignore the problem, it goes away, right? This is a really bad path to take.

Paraphrasing: "Sauna statements with mention of female body parts."

.. note:: WHAT THE FUCK?!?

* "Hire anyone because they are smart, not because of gender."

.. note:: YES! If you are having trouble finding developers, hire smart people regardless of their race, gender, creed, etc and train them up.

* "I have a game: Any time someone says, 'Women tend to' or 'Men tend to', interrupt them and yell 'BULLSHIT!'"

.. note:: Brilliant! I'm going to play this game.

"Is this the right place or platform for this discussion? With so many people watching it's all too easy for me to screw this up and offend someone."

.. note:: Good point. This is very, very hard. We've all made mistakes. I'm not sure what the answer is.

"For those of you wondering about if it's okay to sponsor women/minorities and give special treatment, it makes a huge difference in the lives of those who benefits. Including Audrey Roy"

.. note:: I agree. :-)

"Now is the time. Don't let this fade. Our ancestors fought hard for our rights, lets' keep up the cause"

.. note:: Simple summary of my statement

"Don't make sexist jokes"

.. note:: Awesome
