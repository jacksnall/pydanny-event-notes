Building test frameworks with twill
===================================

Get the docs for this.
I think this is eclipsed by Windmill

What is a test engineer?
--------------------------

    - QA people write a lot of test code
    - Doesn't do much manual testing
    
Some options they don't use
----------------------------

    - Expensive options like Rational Test Suite
    - Windows-only
    
Cases
---------

    * You have tons of tasks to tests and how do you handle mutable tasks?
    
Test framework stack
----------------------
    
    * Nose
    * Scenario objects
    * Order Factory (Abstract State Machine)
    * Page Objects
    * twill.idyll.org (built off Mechanize)
    
    
Pros
------

    * Easy
    * Fast
    * Pythonic

Cons
-------

    * No JS support
    * too simple?
