Django History
======================

Considerations

    * Web development needs to be stupidly fast
    * automate repetitive tasks
    * best practices
        - Obsessed with web standards and best practices
        - You have to enhance, extend, and maintain

Choices
-----------

    * open source
    * BSD license
    * python
    * pragmatism over methodology
        - Didn't care about GoF, MVC, TDD?
    * Why break the standards?
        - A lot of it is snake oil
        - "There is no silver bullet" - Fred Brooks
        - There is the right way and getting things done.
    * Ramifications on questioning anything new
        - "What's the need?"
        - No architecture astronauts
        - You risk reinventing the wheel
        - You can take things to far (Ruby for Rails)
        - Messy internals
    * Web development ought to be fun
        - Rails asks why software development can't be fun
        - APIs should match behavior, not show how they work
    * Good APIs almost documents itself
        - Documentation driven development "DDD"
    * Why does Django ship full stack?
        - Lack of choices at the time of inception
        - Might make separate choices again
        - There is a reason why glue code is called glue code
        - Full control over code means you get to define the API nicely
    * Don't repeat Zope's mistake
        - Don't have people learn Django and not Python
        - Innovation happens elsewhere
        - Always someone smarter outside your own group
        - Small pieces advance quicker
    * Don't make opinionated software
        - Ego is dangerous
        - It is not about you
        - You can't possibly predict what everyone wants
        - There is no "one obvious way"
    * Lots of choices is bad for new users
        - There are always more beginners than experts for your projects
        - Make complicated things easy
    * Choices in the future
        - Long tail or huge scale
        - Learning curves
        - Django in the Enterprise
        - Does Django want to fight STRUTS
        - Avoiding inevitable backlash
            * Inviting criticism and take it well
            * Make conscious decisions
