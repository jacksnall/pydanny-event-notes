State of Pinax

Inspiration - Ole Kirk Christianson
===================================

Legos

 * blocks
 * sets
 * themes
 
Lego sets - Starter projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pinax is **NOT** just for social networks

* zero project = directory layout, static files, deployment
* static project = zero project + static serve
* account project = zero project + account + mailer + uniform
* company project = zero project + blog
* basic project = account project + profiles + notification + announcements
* private beta project = account project + restricted access + waiting list + signup codes
* intranet project = basic project + restricted access + top level content apps (wiki, attachments, tasks, etc)
* code project = basic project + projects + group-based content apps (wiki, attachments, tasks, etc)
* friends project = basic project + friends + invitations
* social project = friends project, blogs, microblogging, usert-to-user messages + LOTS

The Trade off
=============

* How much to fix
* how much to make configurable


Pinax IS Django
===============

* Django doesn't hide python and Pinax doesn't hide Django.
* Pinax is even more opinionated about Django


Questions
=========

* tested on zc.buildout?
* Pinax Project site refactor?
* IE5 CSS corrections
* Pointing new users to Python, Django
