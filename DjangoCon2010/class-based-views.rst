=================
Class based views
=================

by Ben Firshman


 * Views have not been updated since release of Django
 * Generic views are very inflexible
 * newforms-admin use class based views
 
Ben's implementation
---------------------

 * In the request -- views -- reponse stream a view is just a callable (__call())
 * Class based views let you do mixins such as rendering Jinja or JSON values.  This beats Piston, TastyPie, etc by letting you not have to create a separate application framework.
