@jdunck - I want to see features of how Django has changed lives.

@andymckay - You don't need 400 case studies, you need 6 great ones. Writing case studies is really hard.

-- Idea: DjangoCompanies.com

@natea - Plone allowed sponsorship to get higher rankings in company listings.

@audreyr - Feature the community on whydjango.com since other advocacy sites do that.
