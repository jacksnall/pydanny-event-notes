How and why a Java Expert switched to Python (Ron Cox)
========================================================

* Got into Java v1 ages ago
* Worked with servlets to deliver web sites
* About 2.5 years ago was working on mobile tech including Android and iOS work.
* Was tired of Java:

    * Java language wasn't productive enough.
    * Java platform was very resource intensive
    
* New stack::

    Python 3.2
    CherryPy
    MongoDB
    Mailgun
