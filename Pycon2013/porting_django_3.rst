Porting Django apps to Python 3
================================

Django 1.5 now supports Python 3, so now's the time to start thinking about porting your apps and sites. Come see how! I'll talk about the porting techniques that work, and present two case studies: porting a site, and porting a reusable app.

Do I want to use Python 3?
=============================

Python 3 has fewer warts

* `urllib` / `urllib2` replaced with `urlparse`
* std library cleanup
* funky syntax is killed
* `print()` is a function!
* `super()` syntax is better!
* unicode no longer sucks!
